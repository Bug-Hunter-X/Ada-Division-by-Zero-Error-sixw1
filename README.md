# Ada Division by Zero Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: division by zero. The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ada` provides a corrected version.

The bug is caused by a lack of explicit handling for the case where the divisor is zero.  This could lead to a runtime crash.  The solution incorporates a check to prevent this.

## How to run the code

To compile and run the Ada code, you will need a suitable Ada compiler (like GNAT). Compile the code and then run the executable.
